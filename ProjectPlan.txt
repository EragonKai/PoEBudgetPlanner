A GUI interface that allows the user to enter differing amounts of currency, have it converted to the standard,
Chaos orbs, and then select different items and add custom ones to a build plan. This build plan will record the amount
of currency the selected items will cost by pulling data from poe.ninja's api, and help the user budget their build.

This interface will be created with the java swing library, and the Jackson json parser will be used to get data from
poe.ninja.

Use serializable options object?


display a total of chaos added as well as the regular balance


update from a day later:

todo: still gotta make it so that currency adder has a close button
